                    I enjoy helping people solve problems. I also like to build things. I’ve found web development to be a rewarding intersection of the two and it’s been an interest of mine ever since my first job maintaining websites for the UW - Madison College of Letters and Sciences in 2011. I enjoy developing elegant front-end interfaces that please users. I love to learn.

                    Back in 2011, during the summer before my senior year at UW - Madison, I took a <a href="https://sts.doit.wisc.edu/index.aspx" target="_blank">free course on basic web development.</a> I was hooked. In two days I learned about HTML, CSS and setting up a development server. In the five years since I have devoted personal time to several small projects as an outlet for my web development interest.
                    <br><br>
                    Today I consider myself proficient with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I understand enough about jQuery to be dangerous. I know my way around Bootstrap and Foundation, and I think they're excellent frameworks for making the web beautiful. Responsive design blew my mind when I discovered it in Bootstrap, and I appreciate the principles for making websites seamlessly accessible on mobile devices. I enjoy using WordPress to deploy easy-to-manage templated websites for causes I care about. I think GitHub is an awesome tool for keeping track of all my stuff. I've used Adobe Photoshop quite a bit, and I know enough about Illustrator to entertain myself with cool flat designs.
                    <br><br>
                    I've still got plenty to learn, and there are so many interesting technologies out there to explore. Stuff I'm dabbling in right now includes LESS and SASS, Angular, and WordPress theme development.

                        This site was (quite literally) a labor of love built from scratch. I designed thefutureromdennes.com during the summer of 2013 before proposing to my beautiful wife. I took her for a walk along the same path we shared the night of our first date. When we reached the scenic overlook I gave her an iPad to view a JavaScript slideshow (totally nerdy, yes). When the slideshow ended I popped the question, which she excitedly answered with a yes!
                        <br><br>
                        This was the first web project that I built from scratch. I taught myself how to use Bootstrap and built this website to be responsive. I also spent quite a lot of time learning to code JavaScript to get that slideshow working.

                        Soccer happens to be my passion, and I’ve worked with Luxemburg-Casco Soccer Club as a coach and fundraising volunteer for several years. In 2012 we decided a new website was in order, and I was the one to build it. In the first iteration I created a brand new web presence from scratch, using Bootstrap, Foundation and PHP. I maintained that structure for two years, until I decided to update the site to Wordpress for easier upkeep and collaboration with others who aren't as web-savvy as myself.

                        This site is notable for the significant user interface considerations that went into it. The old website was built on a quite dated CMS from the early 2000’s and hadn’t been modernized. Luxemburg-Casco’s District Technology Committee had decided to use the Google Sites platform for its efficient integration with the other tools in the Google Apps for Education suite. The site served L-C’s teachers, students, parents and community members, and with such a wide audience an emphasis on usability was important.
                        <br><br>
                        I was tasked with organizing and populating the website on the Google Sites platform. Google Sites isn’t great from a development perspective, but I managed to manipulate the platform as needed to create the user interface that I thought fit best for an educational institution. I drew inspiration from other education websites and chose a design that prioritized intuitive navigation.
